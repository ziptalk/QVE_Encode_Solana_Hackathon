# QVE_Encode_Solana_Hackathon
QVE Protocol for Solana hackathon of Encode Club



The idea behind QVE is simple. We are a team operating an arbitrage and market making bot. It is quite profitable.

QVE helps customers invest in the arbitrage fund, while also allowing them to liquidate their capital into ETF-like tokens.

QVE provides personalized and profitable services to users at a private fund level. and it ensures continuous liquidity circulation through regular market. Then, helps Dapps participating with QVE to fill the order gap and activate the internal liquidity.

Often there are gaps between the bid - ask prices especially in new exchanges and order-book systems. We narrow those gaps, and if necessary, create our exclusive profit-making strategies in QVE vaults. These vaults allow customers to provide and operate with their own liquidity, which is called a Hybrid AMM Vault. Many customers want to be market makers, and with QVE, they actually have the opportunity to participate in market making. Additionally, QVE add liquidity to “market making capital.”

To users, QVE issues tokens such as arbQVE on the same native chain as the tokens that have entered the platform already.
These tokens play as ETF tokens and Warrants that are rebalanced at certain intervals. If you are the users, then you are receiving automatically rebased tokens whose prices are adjusted, according to the market making performance.

We are going to talk with Openbook and trying to check if we can make suitable Defi Arbitraging system for the entities.
Through these kind of process, we believe LP utilized strategies can be constantly added to Aptos and QVE ecosystem.

In Mid-term vision,
Users will able to update their own investment strategies or provide more liquidity to the vault and LP pool.

In long-term vision,
We are currently designing a business model where entities can use leveraged tactics within our Tokenomics.

QVE is trying to find the best investment strategies and provide Asset Allocation strategies through our Vault.

Ultimately QVE aims to grow into Investment product marketplace of Solana.
